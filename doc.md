## The Live-stream of leadership

### Introduction
Leadership is not like a movie you buy a DVD or go to a cinema to watch.  
It is like a live stream in multiple dimensions happening in us and all around us.  

### Leadership Skills 
They do not matter if you can not live-stream them.

### Everything comes together in a live-stream
All our skills and abilities do not matter if you can not live-stream them  
Not about what you have done in the past or what you will do in the future - but always streaming in the present moment  

## Benefits of looking at leadership this way
### Makes it simple rather than complicated
### Makes it actionable rather than abstract
Not about big abstract concepts like courage, trust, empathy, love, and boldness but about being courageous, empathetic, and loving - at this moment. 
### Makes it measurable rather than vague

## Live-Streaming and Bandwidth
You can not talk about live-streaming without talking about bandwidth
You can operate on limited bandwidth or full bandwidth by understanding some foundational human principles
  
## Three Principles  

1.  Frontend - When you push people, they push back
	1. Autonomy
	2. If you feel you are getting pushback from people, it means you have pushed them in some way 
2. Backend - It is never about speaking or doing. It is always listening and connecting.
	1. the backend of leadership - what is not visible or audible
	2. The power lies in the listener
	3. What is invisible yet more important than the visible.
3. Back from the future - It is always about the future. Not about the past. Are you creating the one you want? 
	1. our future determines our present, not the past
	2. Take action NOW which is aligned to the future.

### Solutions and a fresh look at common problems based on the above principles  
  
#### For each problem

1.  what you need to stop doing
2.  what you need to start doing
3.  and why?

#### Disclaimer  
 > 1.  Simple, not easy.
 > 2. Not about understanding but doing it. About practices - tiny actions that you repeat over time.
 > 3. Give it time. Leadership is like gardening. Do not plant a seed and expect flowers tomorrow

## The Problems

1.  Others are not taking responsibility
	1. Stop - being angry or frustrated at others, being in your own head all the time.
	2. Start - take full responsibility, own the current situation you have as your past actions played a part, acknowledge your role in the situation, then provide feedback, and then trust them. see the whole thing as a learning opportunity for yourself and others. No blame or frustration or anger. Be present and open to what people are saying.
	3. why - responsibility is always 100%
2. I am unable to change, motivate, inspire my people
	1. stop - trying to change / persuade / others. stop trying pushing others to see things the way you see. seeing people for only their titles, roles, money, strengths, weaknesses, history.
	2. start - listening to what matters to them, what do they care about, and start providing work, skills, and other opportunities for the same. start seeing people for who they are deep inside - basically the same as everyone else - with similar desires, dreams, challenges, and fears.
	3. why - inspiration and motivation will happen as an outcome of listening and taking care of what is important to each person, not by tips or strategies
3.  I can’t do people management
	1. Stop - trying to manage people. you can manage processes, tasks, and physical resources. Not people. pleasing people
	2. Start - leading them, by trusting them first, listening to them - their cares and concerns, demonstrating behaviours that you want to see in them (leading by example)
	3. why - åll people have same desires (to succeed, to learn, to contribute, to be happy) and same fears (to be ridiculed, to be found incompetent, to lose, to feel unworthy, to feel unfulfilled, of disagreement and conflict, of uncertainty, insecurity, etc). Relationships determine the quality of all work, and relationships are built by listening, empathy, and supporting others - not by planning, analytical reasoning, or management.
4. I hate meetings and processes
	1. Stop - having any meetings and following any processes that doesn’t make sense - together with others, not unilaterally.
	2. Start - find genuine and valid business reason for each process and meeting. Ask if the right people are involved, for the right duration, at the right time. Does they take care of what matters to the company, team and people? If not, have the courage to start conversations to change or remove them
	3. Why - processes or meetings are never the problem. ineffective ones are. processes are just expectations made explicit - to support the business, teams, and people - never the other way around.
5. My credibility is poor. People do not believe, trust or confide in me.
	1. Stop - saying things and not doing them. saying no or promising what you can not or do not intend to do. keeping bad news to yourself when you know it. letting pride stop you from being vulnerable and honest. Making false promises to yourself - respect and credibility start with your own self-esteem and how you see yourself.
	2. Start - taking your promises seriously - small and big ones. making powerful promises - but only those which you know you can deliver. delivering bad news first - especially about what you are committed to. being honest and apologise or make amends when required. allow others to see your biggest fears and vulnerabilities. Hold yourself to high standards, trust yourself when required, forgive yourself when you mess up, and repeat.
	3. Why - take what you promise or commit to seriously. ask for what people expect from you. say NO if you do not plan or intend to fulfill them. honor your word and your credibility will grow. People will start to trust you, open up, and give you more and more responsibilities and future growth.
6.  I do not know how to handle difficult people or difficult conversations
	1. Stop - seeing other people or conversations as difficult. avoiding them. using this as an excuse for your leadership.
	2. Start - looking for skills you lack and learn them. lean into those conversations so only that will make then “easy” and you will grow and become better.
	3. Why - any conversation or person is not difficult. “Difficult” is a label you add to the person or conversation. It is not an inherent property of that conversation or person. Nothing in itself or no-one in themselves are good or bad, right or wrong, or easy or difficult. It is very easy to label others and situations, but labels stop us from live streaming our leadership.
7. Managing people is a lot of work
	1. Stop - doing back and forth, intervening in small matters, accepting unclear responses of YES and NO, answering questions which people can answer on their own, giving advice
	2. Start - create clear promises, ask for strong commitment, give option to decline, support them when they need it, giving more responsibility, listening and coaching people, developing others as leaders, saying NO to what doesn’t matter or where you are not required (delegate)
	3. Why - advice & control doesn’t work. It only leads to obedience and compliance. While that might feel good to your ego, it doesn’t lead to innovation and creativity. It doesn’t create more leaders
8. I am not getting promoted
	1. Stop - creating followers and yes men. Stop doing other people’s job for them. stop taking more than your share of accountability (while still keeping responsibility). pleasing people
	2. Start - creating more leaders below and above you. coaching as a way of having conversations. having conversations about a shared and powerful future for your teams. saying NO to anything and everything. Start choosing what big and few results you will produce. Learn to stand your ground when required
	3. Why - the job of a leader is to create a better future - NOW - in each moment. And you do grow by helping others and creating more empowered leaders all around you. If you do that, growth will come from all sides.
9. I am only busy in fire-fighting and crises management. It is overwhelming. My calendar is always full
	1. Stop - pleasing others. ignoring other things that matter - family, hobby, health, other passions, etc. taking your worth and value from the work that you do. creating and getting trapped in delusions created by your mind. stop being busy and seeing it as a badge of honour. Do not try to make every minute productive
	2. Start - prioritising yourself (and wellbeing) first. say NO more. create boundaries. give yourself permission to do that. see yourself as a full human being where work plays an important but small role in defining your success, worth, and value as a person. keep white space in your calendar - for silence, reflection, creative thinking - alone. Connect with people that matter, relationships you care about, and spending alone time in nature, or in other activities like reading, running, biking, meditating, etc.
	3. why - you are more than your job or title or accomplishments. the best creative and most meaningful ideas come to you - you do not generate them by will. give space and bandwidth for them to show up. If you always busy, you will have no space for listening - to others and to ideas, and for contributing in a way that matters. You will soon be burned out.
10.  I do not trust people
	1. Stop - blaming people, losing your cool and disrespecting them (with or without that being reflected in words - it always shows), pushing people, telling them what to do
	2. Start - addressing what is missing, acknowledge your role and step up, acknowledge what they are doing right, align on what matters to them and you with what they are doing, fix any missing skill gap, address or coach around any relational or emotional issue you discover
	3. Why - trust is not binary. it is always specific to a particular skill, competency, or to the reliability and sincerity of a person. Give trust fully, provide all support, be available, and then ask for responsibility. Give freedom and autonomy but don’t leave people on their own. Be for them when they need you - even when they themselves don’t know so.
11. A culture of gossip, avoiding responsibility, and carelessness
	1. Stop - throwing your opinion or ideas with everyone you meet, gossiping or talking about those not in the room, speaking ill or questioning other’s intentions,
	2. Start - listen to understand the full context before speaking, speak only when what you have to say will make things better, speak in public or private as appropriate, speak about creating alignment rather than division and friction, speak to create a shared and powerful future rather than who did what in the past.
	3. Why - leadership is about creating a future where people are touched and inspired to contribute. and that happens in conversations (Storytelling) first - always. And every moment is an opportunity for doing so.
12. Leadership is lonely. I feel alone and cornered with a lot of weight and burden on my shoulders.
	1.  Stop - keeping everything in and playing the sole hero role. playing saviour and feeling good about it. seeing leadership as a big responsibility. telling others what to do.
	2. Start - live streaming your fears, thoughts, doubts, and future ambitions. Involve people. asking for help. seeing leadership as a privilege. listening to what is not being said and what everybody wants to tell you. giving opportunity to people to help you - they all want to.
	3. Why - nothing should be a surprise. It never is as people can sense if something good or bad is brewing anyway. leads to unlocking of emotions and energy which is otherwise trapped and create unnecessary pressure - for yourself and others. leadership by definition is working with people
13. Not having confidence. I do not know how to be assertive
	1. Stop - asking for permission from others or looking for outside validation. pleasing others. avoiding disagreement or conflict. seeing confidence as a prerequisite to action. speaking weakly (meekly or whispering). Making it all about you.
	2. Start - ask yourself why is this important, and what is at stake if you do not. ask yourself what kind of person and leader you want to be. how do you want people to describe you after this role, job, or life? The reality now is in front of you. Decide. Speak strongly but wisely. Talk about not just the what you are proposing but also why you are proposing. Then listen and invite disagreements and differing opinions. Stay grounded on your feet, take strength from your ambitions, values, and future vision and speak with weight in your voice. Focus on your company, team, products, and other people.
	3. Why - confidence is an outcome, not a requirement. you do not need confidence to start or take action. you need courage though. Practice. you will make mistakes on the way. it is not unexpected and it is part of the journey. If you avoid all mistakes, you will never be confident. Leadership is not about you - it is what you produce with other people in the world - and how the lives of your colleagues, customers, partners will change because of that.
14. Not having the courage to do the right thing. i am scared
	1. Stop - never delay what you know is the right thing - holding yourself and others accountable, firing people. stop delaying bad news. staying in comfort zone
	2. Start - being transparent not just about information about also about your fears and insecurities. build courage. go beyond the comfort zone. ask for big commitments. make big promises. support people. hold them accountable without blaming them or hurting the relationship. taking tough decisions and holding your ground when needed.
	3. why - without courage - nothing works. you do not overcome your fears, you allow them as part of being human, listen to what they are trying to tell you, create space for others to express their emotions without suppression or explosion, and then take action NOW to create the future you have created and share together with your teams and people
15. More can be added
    

  

Conclusion: Hard Disks have capacities, the internet does not. (from scarcity to abundant, from limited to limitless.)
